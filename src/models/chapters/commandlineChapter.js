        There is still an important part missing: the command-line or console,
        i.e. a text based controlling interface for your computer and the
        default way to work with Git. This may sound old fashioned but it really
        will speed up your workflow with Git, I promise.

        There are plenty of graphical interfaces for Git. But often these only
        support a subset of features. And after all, mastering the console will
        improve your abilities to use any kind of interface for Git.{' '}

        The <strong>prompt</strong> indicates by a dollar sign that the console

        help you to orientate.

        After the command is given you press the <em>enter</em> key on your
